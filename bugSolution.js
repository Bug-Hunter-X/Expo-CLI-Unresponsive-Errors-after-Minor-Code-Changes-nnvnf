While a definitive fix is dependent on the root cause of the inconsistent behavior, a potential workaround is to ensure that your project's dependencies are all up to date.  Also, carefully review the file permissions of your project directory and associated files to ensure read and write access for the user running the Expo CLI.  If these don't resolve the issue, more detailed logging via Expo's CLI options or debugging tools might provide insights into the error.  If the problem persists after trying these steps, reporting the issue to the Expo community could lead to a better understanding and solution.
