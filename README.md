# Expo CLI Unresponsive/Errors After Minor Code Changes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo CLI. After seemingly minor code changes, `expo start` becomes unresponsive or throws obscure errors, like `spawn EACCES`, inconsistently. 

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified example that exhibits similar behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Make a minor change in `bug.js`. (Example: add a console log)
4. Run `expo start`. Observe inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Workarounds (See `bugSolution.js`)

The provided workaround may or may not resolve the issue completely, depending on the underlying cause. Consider these options:

* **Detailed Error Logging:**  Enable more verbose logging options in Expo CLI to gather more detailed information about the error.
* **Project Dependency Updates:** Ensure all project dependencies are up-to-date.
* **File Permissions:**  Verify file permissions and ensure the CLI has access to the project directory and its subdirectories.
* **Reinstallation:** As a last resort, consider reinstalling the Expo CLI.
