While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  When attempting to run `expo start` after making seemingly minor changes to my project's code (like adding a simple component or updating a style), the CLI would become unresponsive, or would throw an obscure error message such as `Error: spawn EACCES` or a similar error relating to file system permissions, without providing sufficient information to pinpoint the cause. This behavior was inconsistent, as sometimes the same code change would run without issues.  Cleaning the cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and restarting the machine did not help.
